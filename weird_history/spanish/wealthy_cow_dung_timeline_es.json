    "script": "En algunas tribus históricas de África Oriental, las parteras tenían el truco más loco para un parto difícil... ¡caca de vaca! Dado que el ganado era el símbolo supremo de riqueza extrema, si un bebé se negaba a salir, tomaban estiércol de vaca fresco, increíblemente maloliente, y lo empaquetaban alrededor de la cama de parto. Honestamente creían que el bebé en el útero podría oler la riqueza y saldría corriendo para nacer rico. ¡Eso sí que es nacer con dinero!
