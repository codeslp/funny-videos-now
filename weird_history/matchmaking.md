# Matchmaking Practices (Part 1: 1-25)

## 1. The Aztec "Cihuatlanque"
**Description:** In the ancient Aztec civilization, families didn't leave love to chance. They hired professional, older female matchmakers known as *cihuatlanque*. These respected women didn't just arrange the marriage; they officiated it by tying the groom's shirt to the bride's dress, and even literally tucked the newlyweds into bed after the party!

## 2. Spring Swallows (Ancient China)
**Description:** In Ancient China, matchmaking wasn't a year-round affair—it was strictly seasonal. The official matchmaking season only began when the first swallows returned in the spring. Families would wait for these birds as a sign of fertility before scrambling to arrange political and social marriages for their children.

## 3. The "Promnestria" (Ancient Greece)
**Description:** Ancient Greek matchmaking was a harsh business. Professional female matchmakers called *promnestria* acted as ruthless go-betweens for families. They were expected to rigorously investigate a potential spouse's character, wealth, and flaws, and bluntly report their findings. The couple often didn't meet until their wedding day!
*   **Visual Elements:** An intimidating older Greek woman in a toga intensely interrogating a nervous young man, writing notes on a tablet, then handing the tablet to a stern father.

## 4. The Utagaki Orgies (Ancient Japan)
**Description:** Before formal matchmaking became the norm, ancient Japan practiced "utagaki." Twice a year, single people from neighboring villages would gather on mountains for competitive matchmaking festivals. They would recite poetry to each other, which inevitably led to massive, culturally sanctioned romantic (and physical) encounters.

## 5. The "Eros" Computer Bureau (1964, England)
**Description:** Long before Tinder or eHarmony, Joan Ball started the "Eros Friendship Bureau Ltd" in 1964 in London.

## 6. The "Try Before You Buy" Hut (Tanzania/Zimbabwe)
**Description:** In some historical African cultures, a father would purposely build a small hut on the edge of his property for his daughter and her prospective suitor. This allowed the young woman to "try before you buy" romantically and physically, while simultaneously keeping the man out of the main family home until he could prove his worth and pay the bride price.

## 7. The Victorian Fan Language (England)
**Description:** Matchmaking was highly restricted for Victorian women, so they invented a secret language using their folding fans to flirt right in front of their chaperones! Fanning fast meant "I'm single," fanning slow meant "I'm taken," and twirling the fan in the left hand meant "We are being watched."
*   **Visual Elements:** A Victorian ballroom. A woman making eye contact with a man and aggressively fanning herself, then abruptly snapping the fan shut to reject him.

## 8. The Ghost Wedding (Ancient China)
**Description:** Chinese matchmakers weren't just for the living.

**Description:** The Nicobarese people of the Indian Ocean practiced "probationary marriage." To ensure a good match, a couple was allowed to live together for several days or weeks.

## 10. The Matchmaking Sisters' Meal Festival (Southwest China)
**Description:** The Miao people's "Sisters' Meal Festival" is an ancient matchmaking event. Single girls cook sticky rice dyed in four colors and hand it to suitors wrapped in a handkerchief.

**Description:** In the Wodaabe tribe, marriages are often arranged during infancy. However, to find true love, a man is allowed to steal another man's wife!

## 12. The "Anadar" Forced Match (Hos of India)
**Description:** Among the Hos people of India, if a woman's family couldn't find her a match or afford a dowry, she could take matters into her own hands via "Anadar."

**Description:** In traditional Jewish communities, matchmaking was a high-stakes, highly respected profession. The *shadchan* (matchmaker) was considered doing God's work.

## 14. Female-Female Marriages for Heirs (Nandi of Kenya)
**Description:** African matchmaking wasn't strictly male-female. Among the Nandi people, if an older married woman was unable to produce a male heir, the elders would arrange for her to "marry" a younger woman. The older woman took on the societal role of a husband, and any children the younger woman had (via designated male surrogates) were legally recognized as the older woman's heirs!

## 15. The "Cup Wedding" Match (Habesha People, Ethiopia)
**Description:** Habesha matchmaking culminates in a fierce "cup wedding."

## 16. Wife-Carrying Matrimony (Finland)
**Description:** Finding a strong match in Finland historically involved literal heavy lifting. This evolved into the modern "Wife Carrying World Championships."

## 17. The "Polterabend" Porcelain Smash (Germany)
**Description:** German matchmaking relies on the theory that couples need to know how to clean up messes together.

The matched couple must then clean up every single shard together to prove they can handle the stress of marriage!

## 18. The "Leftover Garbage Cake" (France)
**Description:** Historical French matchmaking involved a brutal hazing ritual to test a couple's fortitude.

**Description:** In Greek matchmaking traditions, the groom wasn't allowed to get ready alone.

## 20. The Symbolic Kidnapping (Roma Culture)
**Description:** In historic Roma (Romani) matchmaking, if families couldn't agree on a dowry, a young man would perform a highly orchestrated, symbolic "kidnapping" of his bride-to-be.

## 21. The "London Marriage Bureau" (1939, England)
**Description:** Heather Jenner and Mary Oliver opened the first modern "marriage bureau" in London right before WWII.

## 22. The Marriage Brokering Orgy (Ancient Mesopotamia)
**Description:** (As recorded by Herodotus, though debated by modern historians) Ancient Babylonian matchmaking reportedly happened once a year at a massive, brutal marriage auction. The most beautiful women were auctioned off to the highest bidding rich men. The money raised was then given as dowries to poor men who agreed to marry the less conventionally attractive women!

**Description:** In rural Ireland, specifically at the Lisdoonvarna Matchmaking Festival, professional matchmakers like Willie Daly still operate today.

## 24. Marrying a Portrait (Victorian Era)
**Description:** As photography became popular in the Victorian era, "proxy matchmaking" surged. Wealthy pioneers moving to the American West would hire matchmakers back East to find them a bride.

## 25. The Spitting Blessing (Maasai, Kenya/Tanzania)
**Description:** Before an arranged Maasai match is finalized and the bride leaves her family's village, a strange blessing occurs.
