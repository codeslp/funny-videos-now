> *   **Intimacy & Censorship:** NEVER depict actual intimacy. Instead, frame the visuals around the *bizarre setup* (e.g., the crowd outside the room, the odd foods eaten, the protective charms) to keep it strictly G-rated and comedic.
> *   **Banned Words:** Use family-friendly euphemisms ("romance," "bedroom time," "making a baby"). Avoid explicitly sexual or anatomical terms.
> *   **Violence/Sacrifice:** Implied violence or animal sacrifices must be avoided in visuals. Frame rituals as silly historical misunderstandings without showing gore.

## 26. The Post-Wedding Log Sawing (Germany)

**Description:** In 16th-century Italy, romance was pragmatic.
