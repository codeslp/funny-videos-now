> **🚨 CONTENT MODERATION WARNING 🚨**
> Before generating videos from this document, apply these modulation rules to avoid platform bans based on our `content_sourcing_strategy.md`:
> *   **Minors & Age:** If a historical practice involved teenagers or children (common in ancient betrothals), **age-up all characters** in scripts and visual prompts to "adults," "men," or "women." Never use terms indicating minors in a romantic context.
> *   **Violence/Harm:** Avoid animating intense physical harm. If a custom involves hitting (e.g., throwing apples, whipping), prompt the AI with "slapstick," "comedic reaction," and "no blood/injury" to keep it G-rated and victimless.
> *   **Banned Words:** Ensure scripts drop all words from the banned list (e.g., `kill`, `dead`). Replace them with family-friendly euphemisms (e.g., "they met their end").
