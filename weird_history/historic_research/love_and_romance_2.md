> **🚨 CONTENT MODERATION WARNING 🚨**
> Before generating videos from this document, apply these modulation rules to avoid platform bans based on our `content_sourcing_strategy.md`:
> *   **Minors & Age:** If a historical practice involved teenagers or children, **age-up all characters** in scripts and visual prompts to "adults." Never use terms indicating minors in a romantic context.
> *   **Violence/Harm:** Frame any physical rituals (like jumping fires or mock kidnappings) as purely comedic, slapstick, and harmless. Explicitly prompt "no injuries/blood."
> *   **Animal Cruelty:** If an animal is involved (e.g., sacrificing a bird or examining entrails), do NOT show the animal being harmed. Show the funny preparation or the bizarre aftermath.

## 26. Vinegar Valentines (Victorian England)

## 34. Shaving the Groom (Ancient Greece)
**Description:** Before ancient (and some modern) Greek weddings, the groom's best man, or "koumparos," acts as his personal barber. He ceremonially shaves the groom's face clean, symbolizing that the groom is shedding his old, single life and gaining a "clean slate" for his new romantic future.

## 38. The Emotionless Wedding (Congo)
**Description:** In a jarring departure from most joyful romantic celebrations, some Congolese wedding traditions require the bride and groom to keep completely straight, emotionless faces throughout the entire ceremony.

## 40. Celtic Love Knots (Scotland, Ireland, Wales)
**Description:** Ancient Celts wove complex, endless knots out of rope, leather, or carved them into metal. Because the knots had no beginning or end, they symbolized eternal, unbreakable love.

## 41. The Apple Bobbing Oracle (Ancient Celtic Traditions)
**Description:** The party game of bobbing for apples actually has romantic origins!

## 43. Nails in the Doorpost (Ancient Egypt)

## 44. Rowan Berry Necklaces (Baltic Pagans)
**Description:** In pagan traditions in Lithuania and Latvia, a woman would string together a necklace of bright red rowan berries and wear it while taking a moonlit walk with her partner.

## 45. Whispering in Ovens (Middle East / Anatolia)
**Description:** In Levantine folk traditions, women seeking love would wake up at the crack of dawn and whisper the name of the man they desired directly into a cold bread oven or a large water vessel.

*   **Visual Elements:** A woman kneeling down at dawn, softly whispering a man's name into a hollow, empty clay bread oven.

## 46. The Scent of Ambergris (North Africa)
**Description:** Instead of spoken spells, Moroccan and Amazigh folk magic relied on the body.

## 47. Scented Gloves Communication (Victorian England)
**Description:** In the highly restrictive Victorian era, lovers created an entire secret language using physical accessories to bypass chaperones. A woman might drop her handkerchief to signal interest, but "glove language" was complex: biting the tip of a glove meant "I wish to be rid of you," while dropping both gloves meant "I love you."
*   **Visual Elements:** A stiff Victorian ballroom. A woman making intense eye contact crossing the room, then deliberately dropping both of her silk gloves right on the floor.

## 48. Marriage by Trial (Shoshone / Paiute Native Americans)
**Description:** While many ancient cultures strictly forbade intimacy before a formal marriage, many Native American tribes, like the Shoshone, practiced "trial marriages." A young couple would openly live together for a season or a year. If they proved physically and emotionally compatible, they would stay together; if not, they amicably parted ways, no harm done.
*   **Visual Elements:** A young couple sitting together outside a tent, assessing each other thoughtfully. A few months later, they both shrug, shake hands, and walk in opposite directions.
*   **Caption Summary:** Trial Marriages! Living together for a year first—and if you don't like each other, you just walk away!

## 49. The Bird Oracle (Ancient Roman / Greek Valentine's Folklore)
**Description:** Historically, young women tried to predict their romantic futures by staring at the sky on Valentine's Day. The first bird they saw crossing the sky held the answer: A goldfinch meant a wealthy husband; a sparrow meant a poor but romantic husband; and seeing a woodpecker meant she would unfortunately die an old maid!
*   **Visual Elements:** A stressed young woman in a toga staring intensely at the sky. A small woodpecker flies past, and she throws her hands up in utter despair.

## 50. Burying the Heart (Renaissance France)
**Description:** In a true romantic commitment to "till death do us part," some wealthy Renaissance couples took death seriously. Archaeological evidence from France shows cases where a surviving widow or widower had their deceased spouse's heart surgically removed, embalmed in a lead box shaped like a heart, and buried directly on top of their own coffin years later when they died.
*   **Visual Elements:** A lead box shaped like a human heart being lovingly placed onto a wooden coffin by a gravedigger in a macabre, romantic crypt.
