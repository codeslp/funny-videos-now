# Courting & Wooing Practices (Part 2: 26-50)

## 26. Armpit Apples (Rural Austria / Elizabethan England)
**Description:** In a historic display of pheromone-based wooing, a single woman at a village dance would tuck slices of sweet apple into her armpits while she vigorously danced. At the end of the night, she'd approach the man she fancied most and offer him the sweaty, warm apple slice. If he ate it, it meant he accepted her affections!
*   **Visual Elements:** A young woman dancing vigorously in a tavern, then reaching into her armpit to pull out a squishy apple slice and handing it to a nervous man who slowly takes a bite.

## 27. The Welsh Lovespoons (Wales)
**Description:** Since the 17th century, Welsh suitors have wooed women by spending hundreds of hours hand-carving incredibly intricate wooden "lovespoons." These weren't for eating; they were covered in complex symbols (anchors for settling down, vines for growing love). A woman would proudly display her collection of spoons on a wall to show off how many suitors she had!

## 28. "Bundling" and the Chastity Sack (Colonial America)
**Description:** Puritan parents in Colonial America surprisingly allowed courting couples to sleep in the same bed so they could bond without freezing in the winter. However, to prevent any "hanky-panky," the couple was fully clothed, a giant wooden board was placed between them, and sometimes the woman was literally sewn into a heavy canvas "chastity sack" or "bundling bag"!
*   **Visual Elements:** A young couple lying stiffly in bed, separated by a giant plank of wood, with the woman completely immobilized inside a linen sack stitched shut up to her neck.

## 29. The Lupercalia Love Lottery (Ancient Rome)
**Description:** During the wild Roman festival of Lupercalia (the bizarre predecessor to Valentine's Day), wooing was completely randomized. Single men and women would put their names into a massive jar. A "love lottery" was then drawn, and you were forced to be a romantic couple with whoever you were matched with for the entire festival, and sometimes much longer!
*   **Visual Elements:** A Roman priest pulling two names from a clay jar. A happy man and a very disappointed woman are then shoved together to go on a mandatory date.

## 30. The "Empty Sheath" Proposal (Finland)
**Description:** In 19th-century Finland, marriageable single women would walk around wearing completely empty knife sheaths on their belts. To court a woman, a man would casually walk by and slip his personal knife into her sheath. If she kept it there, she accepted his courtship. If she handed it back, he was rejected!
*   **Visual Elements:** A strapping Finnish man walking past a woman and casually sliding a hunting knife into a leather pouch on her hip. She looks at it, smiles, and keeps walking.

## 31. Ticks and Stingray Bile Love Potions (Ancient Greece)
**Description:** Ancient Greek wooing wasn't always romantic poetry. To force someone to fall in love, "suitors" would brew horrifying, potent love potions. Surviving texts show recipes requiring bizarre ingredients like crushed ticks, animal blood, and stingray bile, which were either slipped into the victim's wine or even applied directly to the suitor's body!
*   **Visual Elements:** An ancient Greek man proudly handing a woman a goblet of wine. Inside the cup, you can clearly see a crushed tick floating on the top.

## 32. Ancient Babylonian Temple Toss (Mesopotamia)
**Description:** According to the historian Herodotus, to honor Ishtar (the goddess of love), every Babylonian woman had to sit outside the temple once in her life. She couldn't leave until a random male stranger tossed a silver coin into her lap and said a sacred phrase. The woman had absolutely no choice in the matter and had to go with him!

## 33. Wearing Your Heart on Your Sleeve (Medieval England)
**Description:** The phrase "wearing your heart on your sleeve" literally comes from a Medieval wooing practice! During an annual festival, young men would draw the names of single women from a hat. They would then take the slip of paper and physically pin it to the sleeve of their tunic, wearing it proudly for an entire week to declare their romantic intentions.
*   **Visual Elements:** A medieval knight walking proudly through a village with a small, ragged piece of paper safety-pinned to his armored sleeve that says "MARY" in clumsy handwriting.

## 34. "Vinegar Valentines" (19th Century)
**Description:** In the 1800s, wooing had a dark side. If someone was aggressively courting you and you hated them, you could buy a "Vinegar Valentine." These were extremely cheap, brutally insulting greeting cards featuring grotesque caricatures and mean poems designed to publicly humiliate unwanted suitors and completely crush their romantic dreams.
*   **Visual Elements:** A smug 19th-century man opens a beautifully enveloped Valentine, only to see a drawing of himself looking like a troll with a poem calling him a massive loser. His face drops.

## 35. Salty Bread Dreams (Armenian Folklore)
**Description:** In Armenian folklore, a bizarre courtship ritual takes place on the eve of St. Sargis Day (the patron saint of young love). Unmarried women intentionally eat a large piece of extremely salty bread right before bed, refusing to drink any water. The massive thirst causes a dream where a man brings her water—and whoever that man is, he is destined to be her husband!

## 36. Courting with Underwear Drawstrings (Medieval Arabic Culture)
**Description:** In medieval Arabic romantic literature and culture, giving away a piece of your undergarments was the ultimate sign of interest. Because they wore *sarwal* (loose, two-legged underpants tied with a string), a lover wanting to initiate a serious courtship would casually give their crush the *tikka* (drawstring) from their underwear as a highly suggestive gift!
*   **Visual Elements:** Two medieval figures in beautiful robes standing in an alleyway. One smoothly pulls a long, silk drawstring from their pants and hands it to the other with a wink.

## 37. The Secret Code of Fake Moles (17th Century France)
**Description:** French aristocrats in the 1600s used fake beauty marks called *mouches* (made of black velvet or taffeta) to woo lovers without speaking. The exact placement on the face sent a coded message: a mole near the lip meant "I want to kiss," near the eye meant "I'm feeling roguish," and on the cheek meant "I'm happily taken."
*   **Visual Elements:** A powdered aristocrat aggressively sticking three distinct black velvet dots onto his face in a mirror, checking a codebook to make sure he looks single.

**Description:** To woo Mark Antony and prove she was the most insanely wealthy and powerful woman on Earth, Cleopatra performed the ultimate romantic flex.

## 39. The Taj Mahal (Mughal Empire, India)
**Description:** The ultimate—and most expensive—romantic gesture in human history isn't a diamond, it's a tomb. After his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal died, Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was so devastated that he spent the equivalent of a billion dollars, employing 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants over 22 years, to build the Taj Mahal purely as a monument to his love.

## 40. The Hanging Gardens to Cure Homesickness (Ancient Babylon)
**Description:** King Nebuchadnezzar II loved his wife, Amytis of Media, but she was deeply depressed because flat, hot Babylon looked nothing like her lush, mountainous homeland. To woo her and cure her homesickness, he supposedly ordered the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, a massive, terraced, artificial mountain of trees and waterfalls—one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World!

## 42. Groom "Hand-Gifts" (Medieval Germany)
**Description:** Unlike modern dowries where the bride's family pays, medieval German courtship required a *Morgengabe* or "morning gift."

## 43. Agoge Curse Scripts (Ancient Greece)
**Description:** If normal wooing failed, ancient Greeks used *Agoge*, brutal, aggressive magical love spells.

## 44. The Secret Blanket Courtship (Native American Tribes)
**Description:** Several Native American tribes practice "blanket courting." After getting permission from the elders, a man would approach the woman he wanted to woo while she was out in the village.

## 45. The Mating Dance Assessment (Cherokee Nation)
**Description:** Cherokee courtship is highly observant. A central ritual was an elegant, multi-day mating dance where young, single women dressed in elaborate, brightly colored regalia would perform slow, complex dances. The men were not allowed to join; they had to sit patiently on the edges and quietly observe the women's stamina and grace, deciding who they wanted to officially court.

## 46. The Flute of the Shy Hunter (Lakota Tribe)
**Description:** According to Lakota legend, traditional verbal wooing was too embarrassing for some. So, men utilized a specific, carved cedar "love flute." A suitor would hide in the woods near a young woman's camp and play complex, hauntingly beautiful, bird-like melodies. The music was meant to do the talking for him, drawing the woman out to find him.

## 47. Moccasin Flirting (Blackfoot Tribe)
**Description:** Among the Blackfoot tribe, wooing wasn't solely the job of the men. If a woman had her eye on a specific suitor, she could initiate the courtship by secretly, painstakingly crafting a perfectly fitted pair of beaded moccasins. She would then anonymously leave them outside his tipi. If he wore them the next day, it meant he accepted her advances!

## 48. "Fingering the Stocking" (Medieval France/England)
**Description:** Medieval courtship was terrifyingly public. The entire court, including family members, would escort the new couple to their bedchamber.

The wedding party would literally inspect the bride's discarded leg stockings the next morning as gross proof of the union.

## 49. Throwing Shoes for Luck (Tudor England)
**Description:** Tying cans or old shoes to the back of a newlywed's car is a modern tradition, but it comes from a violent Tudor courtship custom. As a newly betrothed couple left the church, the entire village would rip off their own dirty, heavy leather shoes and violently throw them at the bride and groom! Only if they were physically hit were they considered lucky in love.

## 50. The Tooth-Filing Trial (Balinese Hindu Society)
**Description:** Before any traditional Balinese Hindu could even think about courtship, they had to prove they were spiritually pure by undergoing a torturous rite of passage. In a massive ceremony, a priest would take a metal file and literally grind down the teenager's upper canine teeth. Flattening the teeth supposedly removed animalistic lust and greed, making them pure enough to start dating!
*   **Visual Elements:** A young person lying back looking terrified while a priest holding a metal file violently grinds down their pointy vampire teeth to make them flat.
