# Courting & Wooing Practices (Part 1: 1-25)

## 1. Secret Courtship Whistling (Kickapoo Tribe, Mexico)

## 2. The Flirtation Escort Cards (19th Century America)
**Description:** In late 19th-century America, strict social rules made approaching women difficult. So, resourceful men printed "escort cards" or "flirtation cards." Similar to modern business cards, they featured cheeky pickup lines, jokes, or polite requests to walk the woman home, which men would discreetly slip into a woman's hand.
*   **Visual Elements:** A man in a top hat smoothly passing a tiny printed card to a passing woman. She opens it behind her folding fan, reads a cheeky joke, and blushes.

## 3. Courting "Sing-Sings" (Mt. Hagen, Papua New Guinea)
**Description:** To woo a partner in the Mt. Hagen tribes of Papua New Guinea, men (and sometimes women) participate in massive, competitive "sing-sings." They elaborately paint their bodies, don massive, colorful headdresses made of bird-of-paradise feathers, and perform complex, bouncing mating dances mimicking the birds to attract a lover.
*   **Visual Elements:** A line of men wearing huge, vibrant feather headdresses and bright face paint, bouncing up and down in unison, making bird noises to impress a group of watching women.

## 4. The Force-Feeding "Fat Farms" (Mauritania)
**Description:** Historically in Mauritania (and still practiced in some rural areas), a thicker woman was considered wealthy, beautiful, and the ultimate catch. To ensure their daughters were aggressively wooed by top suitors, parents sent young girls to "fat farms" where they were painfully force-fed massive amounts of camel milk, porridge, and couscous.

## 5. The "Pussy Willow" Soaking (Dyngus Day, Poland)
**Description:** Polish wooing takes a chaotic turn on "Dyngus Day" (the Monday after Easter).

The next day, the girls get their revenge.

## 6. The "Courting Hut" (Zulu Tribe, South Africa)
**Description:** In historic Zulu tradition, a young man was absolutely forbidden from stepping foot in the home of the woman he was courting. To get around this, protective but practical fathers would build a separate, specific "courting hut" on the property where the young couple could meet and woo each other safely under observation.
*   **Visual Elements:** A young man respectfully standing outside a large main house, then walking over to a smaller, newly-built thatched hut to meet a smiling young woman.

## 7. Dropping the Apple (Ancient Greece)
**Description:** In Ancient Greece, apples were the sacred symbol of Aphrodite, the goddess of love. A man wouldn't buy a woman a drink to woo her; he would literally throw an apple at her! If the woman caught the apple and held onto it, it meant she accepted his romantic advances.
*   **Visual Elements:** A Greek man in a toga tossing a shiny red apple across a courtyard. A woman catches it with one hand, smiles, and takes a bite.

## 8. The Viking Warrior Women (Teutonic Tribes)
**Description:** To prove their devotion and win the ultimate respect of their Viking/Teutonic suitors, historic warrior women didn't wait at home.

## 9. The "Swayamvara" Archery Contest (Ancient India)
**Description:** Royal women in ancient India didn't wait to be wooed; they held a *Swayamvara*.

The princess would then publicly choose the winner by placing a flower garland around his neck.

## 10. The Midnight "Harana" Serenade (Philippines)
**Description:** Before texting, Filipino men used the *Harana* to woo women.

## 11. Supervised Community Dances (Purépecha, Mexico)
**Description:** For the ancient Purépecha people of Mexico, a man couldn't just walk up and woo a woman. He had to prove he was a good community member first! The elders would hold strictly supervised community dances. Only after passing the watchful eyes of the elders and proving his dancing skills could a man officially ask to court a woman.
*   **Visual Elements:** A large group of young people dancing respectfully while several stern, older village elders sit in chairs, scrutinizing every single movement.

## 12. Purity Tests for Courting (Ancient Greece/China)
**Description:** In many ancient societies prioritizing family alliances, wooing was heavily monitored for "purity." Before a man would commit to courting a woman, families often subjected the woman to highly invasive, culturally mandated (and scientifically completely unreliable) "purity tests" to ensure she was chaste before negotiations could even begin.
*   **Visual Elements:** An older matriarch sternly holding up a white cloth or inspecting a young, incredibly uncomfortable woman while two families sit nearby waiting for a verdict.

## 13. The "Coded Handkerchief" (Victorian Era, Europe)
**Description:** Victorian society considered blatant flirting scandalous. To woo a man across a crowded room without saying a word, women developed a complex, secret language using a simple handkerchief! Drawing it across her cheek meant "I love you," twisting it in her left hand meant "I wish to be rid of you," and dropping it meant "We will be friends."
*   **Visual Elements:** A Victorian woman locking eyes with a man across a ballroom, then very deliberately and slowly wiping her right cheek with a lace handkerchief.
*   **Caption Summary:** Blatant flirting was illegal, so Victorian women wooed men by using secret codes with their handkerchiefs!

## 14. Sweetgrass Braids (Native American Tribes)
**Description:** For many Native American tribes, wooing wasn't just about the couple; it involved the spiritual world. Instead of flowers, a suitor would harvest sweetgrass, traditionally braid it, and present it to the woman. Sweetgrass is considered a sacred medicine that brings positive energy, clarity, and purifies the romantic intentions between the couple.

## 15. The Love Apple (Historical Europe)
**Description:** The tomato, when first introduced to Europe from the Americas, was not eaten because it was thought to be poisonous.

Suitors would aggressively woo women by gifting them these bright red, allegedly magical "love apples" to display as romantic ornaments!
*   **Visual Elements:** A dashing European suitor grandly presenting a small, bright red tomato on a velvet pillow to a woman, who looks at it like a precious jewel.

## 16. The Bricco (Italian Alps)
**Description:** In historic alpine villages of Italy, wooing required athletic endurance. A suitor seeking a wife had to climb the dangerous, steep mountainside to his loved one's high-altitude village. Once there, he would present her with a *bricco*, a beautifully carved wooden coffee pot, proving he had the stamina and skill to navigate the dangerous terrain to reach her.

## 17. The Kantele Serenade (Finland)
**Description:** Finnish suitors wooed women using the *kantele*, a traditional, hauntingly beautiful lap-harp made of wood.

**Description:** In a stunning reversal of traditional gender roles, Wodaabe men woo women by competing in the "Gerewol"—a literal male beauty pageant!

## 19. Hand-Fast Ribbons (Celtic Tradition)
**Description:** To formalize a courtship and declare their intent to marry, ancient Celts practiced "hand-fasting." The couple would stand together while an elder bound their hands together tightly using colored ribbons or braided cords, literally tying the knot. They would remain tied together for a period of time to prove they could exist physically bound to one another.

## 20. The "Leap Year" Proposal Loophole (Ireland/Scotland)
**Description:** Historically, only men were allowed to woo and propose. But according to an old Irish legend (often credited to St. Bridget and St. Patrick), an exception was made: women were allowed to aggressively woo and propose to men, but *only* on February 29th during a Leap Year! If the man refused her proposal, he was legally fined and had to buy her a silk gown.

## 21. Jumping the Broom (West African / African American)
**Description:** Emerging from enslaved communities in the American South who were legally forbidden from marrying, jumping the broom became a powerful courtship and wedding ritual. To declare their union before their community, a wooing couple would lay a broom on the ground and jump over it together, sweeping away their past single lives and creating a recognized bond.
*   **Visual Elements:** An enslaved couple holding hands securely, leaping joyfully together through the air over a simple straw broom lying on the dirt ground while their community claps.

## 22. The Courting Candle (Colonial America)
**Description:** To strictly monitor how long a man was allowed to woo his daughter in the parlor, a Colonial father would use a "courting candle."

When the wax burned down to the bottom ring, the date was over!

## 23. The Posy Ring (Medieval/Renaissance Europe)
**Description:** Before diamond engagement rings were the standard, suitors in the 15th through 17th centuries wooed women with "Posy Rings" (from *poésie*, meaning poetry). These were simple gold or silver bands with secret, short romantic poems or declarations of love inscribed entirely on the *inside* of the ring, keeping the romantic message a total secret between the couple.

**Description:** In Victorian England, lace-making was a common profession for young women.

## 25. The Truelove Knot (Viking/Nordic Traditions)
**Description:** To woo a partner, Nordic and Viking cultures heavily utilized the "Truelove Knot," an intricate knot design that has no discernible beginning or end, forming a continuous loop.
