    "script": "Midwives in some historical East African tribes had the craziest trick for a difficult labor... cow poop! Because cattle were the ultimate symbol of extreme wealth, if a baby was refusing to come out, they would take fresh, incredibly smelly cow dung and pack it all around the birthing bed. They honestly believed the unborn baby could smell the wealth from inside the womb, and would rush out to be born rich! Talk about being born into money. To read the real historic research behind this, check the link in the description.",
