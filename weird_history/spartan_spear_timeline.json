    "script": "If you thought modern bridal up-dos were stressful, you wouldn't survive Ancient Rome. Before a Roman bride could consummate her marriage, her hair had to be parted not with a comb... but with a razor sharp weapon. Under the supervision of older women, the bride's hair was literally split down the middle using a \"hasta caelibaris\"—an iron spear that had officially been used to kill a gladiator or an enemy soldier! It showed that the bride was conquered, and supposedly blessed her with aggressive fertility. Imagine trying to sit still for that! For the full history of Roman weddings, check the link in the description.",
