    "script": "Victorian women had the most unhinged fertility hack of all time. If you were a single woman or a newlywed bride in 19th-century England, you would take a massive, sticky piece of frosting-covered wedding cake... and shove it directly underneath your pillow before bed. The idea? Sleep on top of the disgusting, crumbling, frosting-smeared mess all night, and you'd be blessed with prophetic dreams of your future husband. By morning, your pillow was destroyed, your hair was full of dried frosting, and you supposedly had a vision of the love of your life. Romance! If you don't believe me, click the link in the description to read the actual research behind this.",
