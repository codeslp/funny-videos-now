    "video_title": "The Secret Blanket Courtship",
    "script": "Forget swiping on Tinder. In some Native American tribes, if a guy wanted to take you on a date, he literally threw a giant blanket over your head in the middle of the street! It was called blanket courting. If a man got permission from the elders, he would approach the woman he liked while she was out in the village. Then, in a massive public gesture, he would wrap his large, woven blanket completely around both of them! This created a tiny, pitch-black, private tent right in the middle of the crowded village so they could whisper to each other. Honestly, in a world without privacy, it's actually incredibly sweet. Best of all? Everyone in the village would completely ignore the giant walking fabric lump out of respect! If you don't believe me, click the link in the description to read the actual research behind this.",
