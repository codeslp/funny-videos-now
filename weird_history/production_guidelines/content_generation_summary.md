# Weird History Video Generation: Methodology & Summary

## Project Overview
This content generation initiative shifts away from our previous "news anchor" format to create a brand new, highly engaging short-form video style centered around **bizarre, funny, and historically accurate cultural practices**.

The goal is to develop highly visual, educational, but deeply comedic content using the Flow TV agent and our `weird_history` research archive.

## New Video Format Ideas
Instead of opening with an anchor ("Welcome back," "Top story," etc.), the videos will dive directly into the content using an aggressive, highly engaging hook.

### The "Bizarre History Reel" Format
1. **The Immediate Hook:** A vibrant, chaotic image of the historical practice instantly appears on screen with a fast-paced voiceover. (e.g., *"Did you know ancient Roman doctors made women chug literal goose semen?! Here's 3 insane ancient childbirth facts!"*)
2. **Visual Prompts:** Use the detailed "Visual Elements" notes from our research to generate highly dramatic, somewhat funny, or shocking imagery of the custom happening in real-time.
3. **Engaging Caption:** Display the concise "Caption Summary" aggressively on screen to retain viewer attention. Keep the text large and easily readable for TikTok/Shorts/Reels.
4. **Citation/Context:** Provide a small, tasteful pop-up citation linking to the source material to maintain educational integrity.
5. **Call-To-Action (CTA):** Every single script MUST end with a spoken Call-to-Action telling the user to verify the facts themselves (e.g., "If you don't believe me, click the link in the description to read the actual research behind this.").
6. **No Clutter:** Skip all intro/outro filler. Move directly from one bizarre fact to the next, ending on the strong CTA.

## Future Development Steps
1. **Pause Previous "News" Content:** The "weird news" style is paused. We will keep its codebase structure intact should we ever want to return to it.
2. **Setup the New Workflow:** Integrate the `weird_history` markdown files directly into the Flow TV or video generation prompt templates.
3. **Prompt Engineering:** Use the specific "Visual Elements" we wrote to craft text-to-image/text-to-video prompts that perfectly match the bizarre nature of the historical event.
4. **Volume Generation:** With over ~250 unique facts researched across 5 categories, we have enough content to generate months of daily historical shorts.
