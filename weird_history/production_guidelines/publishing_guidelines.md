# Weird History: Publishing Guidelines

This document outlines the standard operating procedures for taking a finalized video from the `output/` directory and publishing it to social platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels).

## 1. Description & Metadata
Every video published must contain a standardized description format to maximize SEO, algorithmic reach, and fulfill our research requirements.

### Required Elements:
1.  **The Hook:** A 1-2 sentence compelling summary of the video's premise.
2.  **The Call-To-Action (CTA):** A phrase encouraging engagement (e.g., "Would you try this? Let us know in the comments!").
3.  **The Research Link (CRITICAL):** Every video MUST contain a link to the foundational research or historical article that the video is based on. If the user doesn't believe the facts, this provides the proof. 
    *   **LINK VERIFICATION:** Before publishing *any* link, you must verify that the URL is currently active and resolvable. Do not post broken or dead links. If the documented link is dead, find a new, valid historical source to link instead.
    *   *Format Example:* `📖 Read the full historical research here: [LINK]`
4.  **Hashtags:** Include 5-7 relevant hashtags (e.g., `#weirdhistory`, `#historyfacts`, `#victorianera`, `#educationalcomedy`).

## 2. Platform Nuances
*   **TikTok:** Prioritize the hook in the first line of the caption. The research link should be pasted directly into the caption (users will have to copy/paste it, but the algorithm scans it).
*   **YouTube Shorts:** The research link MUST be placed in the main description box so it serves as a clickable external link.
*   **Instagram Reels:** Focus on high-quality hashtags. Put the research link in the caption and prompt users to "Read the link in bio for more weird history" if we set up a Linktree.
