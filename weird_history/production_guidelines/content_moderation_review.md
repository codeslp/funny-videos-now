# Weird History Content Moderation & Modulation Strategy

Based on the rules outlined in `content_sourcing_strategy.md`, some of our researched historical practices intersect with banned topics, algorithmic suppressions, or problematic themes. Here is a breakdown of the problematic historical topics we recorded across our 250+ entries, why they are risky, and how we must modulate them for video generation to avoid content strikes.

## 1. Involvement of Minors / Child Brides
**The Problem:** History is full of child marriages and teenage courtship rituals (e.g., the Nicobarese "trial cohabitation" which involved teenagers, or historical royal child betrothals). The content strategy clearly states "Anything involving minors" is an absolute no-go.
**Modulation Strategy:**
- **Age-Up the Characters:** When writing scripts or generating image/video prompts, *never* use words like "teenager," "child," "boy," or "girl" in a romantic/intimate context. Always replace them with "young adults," "men," and "women."
- **Skip if Unsalvageable:** If the absurdity of the historical fact relies entirely on the participants being children, drop the fact entirely. We have over 200 other safe facts to use.

## 2. Sexual Content & "Intimacy/Consummation"
**The Problem:** Our "Intimacy Customs" and "Childbearing" categories inherently touch on reproduction. Words from the banned list like `sexual` or concepts like "virginity tests," "consummation," "phallic symbols" (e.g., Cerne Abbas Giant, Roman Mutinus Titinus), and "procreative power" can easily trigger NSFW filters on TikTok or YouTube Shorts.
**Modulation Strategy:**
- **Use Euphemisms in Voiceovers:** Replace explicit anatomical or sexual terms with comedic, family-friendly euphemisms (e.g., "making a baby," "romance," "bedroom time," "fertility luck"). Do not use the banned word `sexual` in the script.
- **Visual Censorship:** When prompting Veo3 for video, ensure the visual prompts explicitly state "fully clothed," "tasteful," "comedic reaction shot," and "G-rated." For example, instead of showing a couple in bed, show the *guests* outside the bedroom door listening hilariously (e.g., for the bedding ceremonies).
- **Clothing Ban List:** ANY reference to "sheer", "see through", or "skimpy clothing" is absolutely banned in prompts.
- **Focus on the Absurd Setup, Not the Act:** For things like the Cerne Abbas Giant, focus on the couple carrying a sleeping bag up a giant funny chalk drawing, avoiding explicit anatomical focus.

## 3. Violence, Death & Animal Sacrifice
**The Problem:** The banned word list includes `death`, `dead`, `died`, `kill`, and platforms suppress glorified violence. Ancient history is incredibly brutal. Many of our facts involve:
- *Human Sacrifice* (Aztec virgin sacrifice for Xochiquetzal).
- *Animal Sacrifice / Parts* (Lupercalia bloody goatskins, powdered pig testicles, drinking goose semen, cutting up live snakes).
- *Physical Violence* (Shooting the bride with arrows in China, the Povitukha drop-kicking pregnant women, beating the South Korean groom's feet with a fish).
**Modulation Strategy:**
- **Censor "Death" and "Kill":** Do not use these exact words. Say "they didn't survive," "met their end," or "were sacrificed to the gods."
- **Imaginative Workarounds for Visual Violence:** We must NEVER show blood. If the custom involves violence, find an imaginative workaround (e.g., showing falling rose petals or red fabric instead of blood), show something related to the violence, or avoid the violence altogether.
- **Cartoonish Re-framing for Violence:** For practices involving physical hitting (e.g., throwing peas, beating feet, shooting blunt arrows), frame the visual prompts to look slapstick and cartoonish, not painful.
- **Implied Animal Rituals:** If a script mentions an animal part (like a rabbit foot or goat skin), do not show the animal being harmed. Show the *aftermath* (a person holding a leather strip or a funny-looking dried fish) or the *preparation* (a guy chasing a perfectly healthy goat).
- **Drop Human Sacrifice Entirely:** Aztec skin-wearing or human sacrifice violates the "Tragedy, violence, death" rule and the victimless rule. Skip these facts entirely for the videos.

## 4. Medical Horrors & Drugs
**The Problem:** The "Childbearing" section contains terrifying medical practices (e.g., 1920s tapeworm diets, smoking for smaller babies, "Twilight Sleep" morphine cocktails, blood-sucking leeches). The banned list includes `drugs`, `cocaine`, `heroin`, etc.
**Modulation Strategy:**
- **Avoid Banned Drug Terms:** "Twilight Sleep" used morphine/scopolamine. Just refer to it as a "bizarre ancient memory-wiping medicine" rather than naming specific narcotics.
- **Focus on the Doctor's Incompetence:** Make the doctor the butt of the joke. The humor should stem from "can you believe how terrible medicine used to be?" rather than glorifying the suffering of the patient.
- **No Body Horror:** Visuals of leeches or surgical tools should be framed comedically—perhaps a wide shot of a woman looking annoyed at a jar of leeches—rather than close-ups of blood or medical gore.

## Summary Checklist for Video Scripts
Before rendering any Weird History video, ensure:
1. [ ] No banned words used in the script.
2. [ ] No minors involved in romance/marriage stories.
3. [ ] No blood, gore, or direct animal/human sacrifice shown.
4. [ ] Intimacy is implied through funny reactions, never explicitly depicted.
5. [ ] Medical/drug references are softened to "ancient remedies" and frame the historical doctor as foolish.
