Inside a fast-food restaurant's cramped, fluorescent-lit back office. A cheerful but stern 'Corporate Training Facilitator' in a too-tight Burger King uniform points to a laminated chart titled 'Engagement Metrics'. Two exhausted Burger King employees, one a cynical 'Straight Man' with heavy bags under his eyes, the other an overly eager 'Eager Employee' with a forced, wide smile, both wear bulky, futuristic, white plastic headsets with blinking blue lights over their Burger King uniforms. The Straight Man glares suspiciously at his headset. MOCKUMENTARY handheld medium shot, institutional lighting, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Corporate Facilitator: (peppy, corporate drone) AI tracks all greetings now.
Straight Man: (flat, defeated) All of them?
Eager Employee: (forced enthusiasm) My headset just glowed green!
