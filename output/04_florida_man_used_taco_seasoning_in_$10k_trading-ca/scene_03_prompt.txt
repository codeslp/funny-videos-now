A brightly lit, makeshift factory floor. Trading cards move along a rickety conveyor belt through a large, absurdly rustic 'TACO SEASONING SPRINKLER 5000' machine, which showers them with vast quantities of orange powder. A wild-eyed, disheveled FLORIDA MAN, wearing a chef's hat stained with seasoning, proudly gestures to the operation. DETECTIVE MILLER stands utterly defeated, staring into the middle distance. DETECTIVE GARCIA diligently takes notes, looking impressed. A hand-painted sign reads: 'AUTHENTIC AROMA = MAXIMUM PROFITS!' CAMERA: Wide shot, showcasing the ludicrous scale, then slow push-in on Miller's face, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Florida Man: (beaming) 'The Crunch Method'! Untraceable, until now!
