=== SCENE 1 ===
DETECTIVE MILLER, a grizzled, tired detective in a rumpled suit, stares in disbelief at an evidence table. DETECTIVE GARCIA, younger and overly enthusiastic, holds up a half-empty packet of 'Taco Fiesta Seasoning' with pride. The table is covered in plastic baggies containing other mundane items like a used napkin and a cheap pen. CAMERA: Medium shot, focusing on their expressions and the seasoning packet, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Detective Garcia: (earnest) Found this. Critical clue, Miller.

=== SCENE 2 ===
FORENSICS TECH, wearing a lab coat and sterile gloves, meticulously brushes a fine orange powder onto a cheap, non-holographic trading card. DETECTIVE MILLER watches, shoulders slumped, a single bead of sweat tracing his temple. DETECTIVE GARCIA leans in, fascinated, almost smelling the card. The lab bench is pristine white. CAMERA: Close-up on the card and the tech's hands, then quickly pans to Miller's deadpan face, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Forensics Tech: (clinical) The powder mimicked the valuable card's unique texture.

=== SCENE 3 ===
A brightly lit, makeshift factory floor. Trading cards move along a rickety conveyor belt through a large, absurdly rustic 'TACO SEASONING SPRINKLER 5000' machine, which showers them with vast quantities of orange powder. A wild-eyed, disheveled FLORIDA MAN, wearing a chef's hat stained with seasoning, proudly gestures to the operation. DETECTIVE MILLER stands utterly defeated, staring into the middle distance. DETECTIVE GARCIA diligently takes notes, looking impressed. A hand-painted sign reads: 'AUTHENTIC AROMA = MAXIMUM PROFITS!' CAMERA: Wide shot, showcasing the ludicrous scale, then slow push-in on Miller's face, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Florida Man: (beaming) 'The Crunch Method'! Untraceable, until now!
