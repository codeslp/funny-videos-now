    "script": "Finding out you were pregnant in the early 1500s was just a massive guessing game... until the Tudor Needle Test! Forget peeing on a boring plastic stick. They literally dropped a metal sewing needle into a wooden bowl filled with urine. If the needle rusted or turned bright red a few days later, congratulations, you were officially declared pregnant! To read the crazy actual research behind this disgusting historical test, check the link in the description!",
