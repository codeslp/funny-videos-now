      "veo3_visual_prompt": "Inside a fast-food restaurant's cramped, fluorescent-lit back office. A cheerful but stern 'Corporate Training Facilitator' in a too-tight Burger King uniform points to a laminated chart titled 'Engagement Metrics'. Two exhausted Burger King employees, one a cynical 'Straight Man' with heavy bags under his eyes, the other an overly eager 'Eager Employee' with a forced, wide smile, both wear bulky, futuristic, white plastic headsets with blinking blue lights over their Burger King uniforms. The Straight Man glares suspiciously at his headset. MOCKUMENTARY handheld medium shot, institutional lighting, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.",
      "dialogue": "Corporate Facilitator: (peppy, corporate drone) AI tracks all greetings now.\nStraight Man: (flat, defeated) All of them?\nEager Employee: (forced enthusiasm) My headset just glowed green!",
      "audio_cues": "Subtle corporate jingle fades in, low whirring from headsets, distinct 'ding!' sound from Eager Employee's headset."

      "veo3_visual_prompt": "At a fast-food counter, brightly lit by harsh fluorescents. The Eager Employee, still wearing their bulky AI headset, performs an exaggerated, almost theatrical 'welcome' to an invisible customer, mouth stretched impossibly wide, eyes unblinking, head tilting unnaturally. A large, flashing red 'SINCERITY: 12%' graphic is projected onto the side of their headset. The Straight Man is slowly and deliberately wiping the counter with a grimy cloth, completely ignoring the Eager Employee, his face a mask of silent, profound despair. A 'Teamwork Makes the Dream Work' poster hangs crookedly on the wall behind them. MOCKUMENTARY handheld medium shot, harsh fluorescent lighting, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.",
      "dialogue": "Eager Employee: (overly cheerful, strained) Welcome! Your visit truly brightens my day!\nStraight Man: (muttering, barely audible) My soul is empty.\nCorporate Facilitator (O.S.): (voice slightly distorted, from a walkie-talkie) Sincerity scores are critical, people.",
      "audio_cues": "Loud, robotic female voice says 'SINCERITY ALERT. Engage!', the headset's red light pulses with a rhythmic hum. Eager Employee's strained vocalizations. Faint crackle from a walkie-talkie."
