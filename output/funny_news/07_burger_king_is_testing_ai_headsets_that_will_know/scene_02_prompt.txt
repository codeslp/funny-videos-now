At a fast-food counter, brightly lit by harsh fluorescents. The Eager Employee, still wearing their bulky AI headset, performs an exaggerated, almost theatrical 'welcome' to an invisible customer, mouth stretched impossibly wide, eyes unblinking, head tilting unnaturally. A large, flashing red 'SINCERITY: 12%' graphic is projected onto the side of their headset. The Straight Man is slowly and deliberately wiping the counter with a grimy cloth, completely ignoring the Eager Employee, his face a mask of silent, profound despair. A 'Teamwork Makes the Dream Work' poster hangs crookedly on the wall behind them. MOCKUMENTARY handheld medium shot, harsh fluorescent lighting, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Eager Employee: (overly cheerful, strained) Welcome! Your visit truly brightens my day!
Straight Man: (muttering, barely audible) My soul is empty.
Corporate Facilitator (O.S.): (voice slightly distorted, from a walkie-talkie) Sincerity scores are critical, people.
