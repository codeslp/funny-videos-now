PRIEST MICHAEL, mid-30s, earnest and clean-shaven, in a neatly pressed black cassock, excitedly taps and scrolls through content on a gleaming smartphone held close to his face, a look of impressed concentration on his features. He's in a cluttered sacristy, shelves behind him packed with ancient liturgical books and a half-eaten bag of convenience store snacks. CARDINAL BENEDICT, mid-40s, sharp but with a faint shadow of fatigue under his eyes, in immaculate cardinal robes, stands slightly behind and to the side, peering over Michael's shoulder with a mixture of curiosity and mild apprehension. CAMERA: Medium shot, static, slightly low angle. STYLE: Soft, warm lighting, hinting at sacred but lived-in space. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio
