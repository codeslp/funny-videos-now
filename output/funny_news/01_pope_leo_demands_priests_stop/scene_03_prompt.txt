POPE LEO, now visibly trembling with frustration, is standing before a majestic, ancient stained-glass window in a grand papal hall, trying to dictate a stern decree into a sophisticated voice-to-text AI device. The device, sleek and futuristic, sits on a heavy velvet stand. Behind him, on a massive, wall-mounted display screen, his words 'By Papal Decree, I demand a cessation...' are being graphically auto-corrected and enhanced by the AI into a rapidly animating, neon-lit text graphic that reads: 'DROP THE MIC, NOT THE CROSS! #POPELEO #AIPREACHBAN #GETOFFMYTIKTOK'. CARDINAL BENEDICT, standing perfectly still a few feet away, has completely given up; his head is slightly bowed, eyes closed, a single tear slowly rolling down his cheek. CAMERA: Dolly-out, revealing the full absurdity of the screen behind the Pope and Benedict's utter despair. STYLE: Epic, dramatic lighting, juxtaposed with the garish screen, extreme visual irony. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

DIALOGUE: Pope Leo: (shouting, exasperated) '—I DEMAND an IMMEDIATE cessation of all AI-generated sermon content! EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY!'
AI Voice: (cheery, synthesized, echoing through the grand hall) 'Okay, Boomer! Serving up some serious righteous vibes with this decree! Hashtag blessed!'
