DETECTIVE MILLER, a grizzled, tired detective in a rumpled suit, stares in disbelief at an evidence table. DETECTIVE GARCIA, younger and overly enthusiastic, holds up a half-empty packet of 'Taco Fiesta Seasoning' with pride. The table is covered in plastic baggies containing other mundane items like a used napkin and a cheap pen. CAMERA: Medium shot, focusing on their expressions and the seasoning packet, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Detective Garcia: (earnest) Found this. Critical clue, Miller.
