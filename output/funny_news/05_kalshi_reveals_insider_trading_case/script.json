Across from him, MARTHA (50s, severe bun, crisp blazer, stern expression) points a laser pen at a large projection screen showing abstract market charts. CHAD (20s, intense, earnest expression, wearing a black MrBeast logo hoodie) sits rigidly. Sterile office lighting. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.",

Behind it, CHAD'S face (intense, focused, partially obscured) is lit by the screen's glow.

In the foreground, DETECTIVE MILLER'S face (expressionless, eyes vacant, staring deadpan at the duck) is prominent. MARTHA (smug, self-satisfied smile) stands proudly beside the evidence. CHAD (arms crossed, beaming with pride) is partially visible in the background. Harsh fluorescent office lighting. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.",
