📐 ASPECT RATIO: 9:16 Vertical (Phone)
⚡ MODE: Veo 3.1 Fast

------------------------------------------------------------

🎥 SCENE 1

  VISUAL PROMPT FOR VEO3:
  AGENT THOMPSON, a stern woman in a crisp suit, leans aggressively across a stark, stainless-steel table. AGENT MILLER, a weary-looking man in a rumpled suit, sits silently beside her. BRAD, a disheveled young man with wide eyes, nervously clutches his hands. A single, bare bulb hangs overhead. CAMERA: Medium shot, static, capturing the tension. STYLE: Harsh, fluorescent lighting, oppressive mood. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

  🎙️ DIALOGUE:
  Agent Thompson: (intense, accusatory) This isn't just about knowing 'who wins the Squid Game recreation.' This is about material non-public information, Mr. Jensen. Financial markets were impacted.
Brad: (stammering) I… I just knew MrBeast thought the green light, red light girl looked a little too… unenthusiastic. So he'd probably cut her out early.

  🔊 AUDIO:
  Hum of fluorescent lights, subtle clinking of Brad's hands, sharp intake of breath from Thompson.

------------------------------------------------------------

🎥 SCENE 2

  VISUAL PROMPT FOR VEO3:
  AGENT THOMPSON gestures forcefully at a whiteboard filled with complex flowcharts and graphs, all meticulously detailing 'Viewer Retention,' 'Engagement Spikes,' and 'Optimal Jump Scare Placement.' AGENT MILLER pinches the bridge of his nose, eyes closed in quiet despair. BRAD stares blankly at the board, completely overwhelmed. CAMERA: Slow push-in on the whiteboard details, then a close-up on Miller's face, then back to the scene. STYLE: Overly dramatic presentation, clinical lighting. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

  🎙️ DIALOGUE:
  Agent Thompson: (pointing with a laser pointer) And here, Mr. Jensen, you bet heavily on 'MrBeast's Editor Pranks His Crew Part 3' underperforming. Why? How did you know the giant rubber chicken wouldn't get a laugh?
Brad: (confused, quiet) Because… because it broke. During the first take. We had to use the one with the slightly deflated comb. It wasn't as funny.

  🔊 AUDIO:
  Whirring sound of a projector, faint squeak of Thompson's laser pointer, Miller's quiet, exasperated sigh.

🎥 SCENE 3

  VISUAL PROMPT FOR VEO3:
  A grand, oak-paneled hearing room. AGENT THOMPSON stands triumphantly at a podium, a massive, ornate gavel resting beside her. On a giant screen behind her, a blurry, extreme close-up of a half-eaten sandwich with a single bite mark is projected. BRAD sits slumped in a witness chair, looking utterly defeated, tears welling in his eyes. AGENT MILLER sits in the front row, completely motionless, staring straight ahead with dead eyes, a single, unblinking tear tracing a path down his cheek. CAMERA: Static locked-off wide shot of the hearing room, slowly zooming out to reveal the full absurdity. STYLE: Formal, oppressive, yet absurdly lit on the sandwich. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

  🎙️ DIALOGUE:
  Agent Thompson: (dramatically, booming) And the smoking gun, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the definitive piece of insider information that caused a near-catastrophic market correction in the 'Will MrBeast actually finish that 10,000 calorie pizza?' market…
Brad: (sobbing) He said it tasted like… like sadness. He wasn't going to finish it. I just… I knew!

  🔊 AUDIO:
  Dramatic courtroom music swells briefly, then cuts abruptly to Brad's sob. The faint whir of the projector, a single drip of water from a leaky ceiling somewhere in the background, amplifying Miller's silent despair.
