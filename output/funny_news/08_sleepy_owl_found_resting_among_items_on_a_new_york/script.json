      "veo3_visual_prompt": "An eccentric proprietor, 60s, wearing a dusty velvet jacket and thick glasses, stands proudly next to a tall, cluttered antique shelf. Perched stiffly among ornate teacups and tarnished figurines is a large, incredibly still owl, eyes half-closed. A long-suffering employee, 20s, in a wrinkled apron, slowly polishes a small, tarnished brass bell nearby, shooting exasperated glances at the owl, then a quick, deadpan look directly into the camera. CAMERA: Handheld medium shot, slight sway, focusing on the proprietor and owl, then cutting to the employee's reaction. STYLE: Warm, dusty, slightly chaotic antique store lighting. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.",
      "dialogue": "Eccentric Proprietor: (boastful) A living curio. Very rare.\nLong-Suffering Employee: (tired murmur) It just\u2026 showed up.\nEccentric Proprietor: (proudly) Excellent condition. Minimal dust.\nLong-Suffering Employee: (to camera, deadpan) It's just a bird.\nEccentric Proprietor: (whispering conspiratorially) Only forty-five hundred.",
      "audio_cues": "Faint, distant street noise. Gentle tinkling of wind chimes. Occasional low 'hoo' from the owl. Soft, melancholic indie music score."
