An eccentric proprietor, 60s, wearing a dusty velvet jacket and thick glasses, stands proudly next to a tall, cluttered antique shelf. Perched stiffly among ornate teacups and tarnished figurines is a large, incredibly still owl, eyes half-closed. A long-suffering employee, 20s, in a wrinkled apron, slowly polishes a small, tarnished brass bell nearby, shooting exasperated glances at the owl, then a quick, deadpan look directly into the camera. CAMERA: Handheld medium shot, slight sway, focusing on the proprietor and owl, then cutting to the employee's reaction. STYLE: Warm, dusty, slightly chaotic antique store lighting. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Eccentric Proprietor: (boastful) A living curio. Very rare.
Long-Suffering Employee: (tired murmur) It just… showed up.
Eccentric Proprietor: (proudly) Excellent condition. Minimal dust.
Long-Suffering Employee: (to camera, deadpan) It's just a bird.
Eccentric Proprietor: (whispering conspiratorially) Only forty-five hundred.
