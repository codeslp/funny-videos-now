Investigator Davis, a grizzled, middle-aged detective in a rumpled suit, squints at a thick medical file. His desk is cluttered with case folders and half-eaten snacks. Chief Reynolds, a calm, slightly overweight woman in a neat blouse, sips coffee beside him, looking unfazed. CAMERA: Medium shot on Davis, slowly pushing in to highlight his exhaustion. STYLE: Muted office lighting, weary mood. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Chief Reynolds: (calmly) Officer Rodriguez claims a bad back.
Investigator Davis: (muttering, defeated) Another one.
