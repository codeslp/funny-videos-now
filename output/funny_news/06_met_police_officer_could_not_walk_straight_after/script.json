His expression is a subtle mix of disbelief and resignation. In the background, out of focus, a DRUNK OFFICER in a slightly rumpled police uniform struggles to pick up a pen, swaying slightly. A CHIEF INSPECTOR, mid-40s, pristine uniform, tries to subtly steady the DRUNK OFFICER's arm. CAMERA: Static medium shot on INVESTIGATOR, subtle rack focus to background absurdity. STYLE: Harsh, institutional fluorescent lighting, cinematic, slightly desaturated colors. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio",

      "veo3_visual_prompt": "A medium shot, eye-level, of the DRUNK OFFICER, mid-30s, uniform now visibly disheveled, attempting to walk a straight line across a brightly lit, sterile police conference room. The DRUNK OFFICER dramatically veers left, then rights themself by grabbing a 'POLICE CODE OF CONDUCT' poster and nearly pulling it off the wall. The CHIEF INSPECTOR, standing beside the 'straight line' (a strip of hazard tape), forces a confident smile, arms crossed. The Internal Affairs Investigator is visible in the background, out of focus, slowly shaking his head. CAMERA: Tracking shot, handheld, following the DRUNK OFFICER's wobbly path. STYLE: Overly bright, clinical lighting, cinematic. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio",
      "dialogue": "Chief Inspector: (strained cheerfulness) Perfectly linear, Investigator.",
      "audio_cues": "Loud, exaggerated 'thump' as poster is yanked. A small, involuntary hiccup from the Drunk Officer. The Investigator's almost imperceptible sigh."
