🎥 SCENE 1

  VISUAL PROMPT FOR VEO3:
  SABA (30s, modest olive-green tunic, determined expression) is seated opposite CHAIRMAN FAHAD (60s, stern face, traditional flowing white robes, heavy silver ring, adjusting spectacles). CLERK ZAHIR (20s, grey uniform, furiously scribbling in a large leather-bound ledger) sits beside Fahad, head down. Saba leans slightly forward, holding a crumpled legal document. Fahad holds a much larger, ornate ledger open on his dusty wooden desk, finger tracing lines. Zahir's pen scratches furiously. A brass teapot and flickering oil lamp are on the desk. A faded 'Justice Prevails' tapestry hangs crookedly on the mud-brick wall behind Fahad. Medium shot, slightly low angle on Saba, then a slow push-in to a close-up on Fahad's face as he speaks. Warm, oppressive golden hour lighting filtering through a small window, gritty realism, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

  🎙️ DIALOGUE:
  SABA: (earnest but hopeful) But Excellency, surely two weeks for a broken arm is… lenient? She needed surgery.
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (calm, authoritative) The new code is clear. Section 7b. Assault causing minor fracture: two weeks. Next case.
SABA: (confused, a slight frown) Next case? But the severity...
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (interrupting smoothly) Mistreating a desert dromedary, however, per Section 12c, carries a five-month incarceration. Perhaps even flogging.

  🔊 AUDIO:
  Distant street sounds, quill scratching, metallic clang of spectacles, a low, ominous drone begins subtly

🎥 SCENE 2

  VISUAL PROMPT FOR VEO3:
  SABA (face now showing tightly controlled frustration, eyes slightly wide with disbelief) is staring, unblinking, directly at the camera. CHAIRMAN FAHAD (calm, meticulous, his eyes focused) is delicately polishing a miniature, intricately carved wooden camel figurine with a small silk cloth on his desk. CLERK ZAHIR (grinning, eager to contribute, holding up a small scroll) looks expectantly at Fahad. Saba clenches her jaw. Fahad slowly rotates the camel figurine in his hand. Zahir unfurls the scroll. The camel figurine catches the dim light. Behind Zahir, a framed certificate reads 'Outstanding Service to Livestock.' Close-up on Saba's face, then cuts to a close-up on Fahad's hands polishing the camel, then a quick medium shot of Zahir. Muted, oppressive lighting, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

  🎙️ DIALOGUE:
  SABA: (voice tight, trying to remain respectful) Forgive my persistence, Excellency, but a human life… a broken bone versus… a slightly unhappy camel?
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (without looking up from polishing) A slightly unhappy camel can lead to a deeply unhappy caravan. A deeply unhappy caravan disrupts commerce. Disrupted commerce destabilizes the region. Do you wish to destabilize the region, Saba?
SABA: (swallowing, a beat of silence) No, Excellency. Of course not.
CLERK ZAHIR: (eagerly) And for disturbing the sleep of a rare white falcon? Article 19g states a full year, Excellency!

  🔊 AUDIO:
  Soft cloth buffing wood, rustle of parchment, a distant bird cry, Saba's strained breath

🎥 SCENE 3

  VISUAL PROMPT FOR VEO3:
  CHAIRMAN FAHAD (suddenly alert, eyes wide with genuine horror, clutching his chest) has just dropped a beautiful, ceremonial camel staff (carved wood with silver inlay), which lays on the dusty floor. SABA (slumped, utterly defeated, expressionless save for a single tear silently tracing her cheek) stares vacantly forward. CLERK ZAHIR (terrified, wide-eyed, holding a tiny, fluffy white PUPPY that is yelping loudly) is frozen in fear, the puppy wiggling in his grasp. Fahad stumbles back from his desk, knocking over a stack of scrolls. Saba doesn't move, barely registers the chaos. Zahir tries to comfort the puppy but is more afraid of Fahad's reaction. A 'Protect Our Dromedaries' poster is visible in the background. Slow push-in on Fahad's horrified face, then a quick cut to an extreme close-up of the yelping puppy, then a static medium shot of Saba's utterly defeated expression, focusing on the tear. Dramatic lighting, sharp contrasts, heightened absurdity, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

  🎙️ DIALOGUE:
  SABA: (resigned, almost whispering) What about… a more severe human crime? What if someone… killed a person?
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (ponders, then waves a dismissive hand) Oh, a person? Ah, Article 21a. Family dispute. Perhaps a fine. Or a stern talking-to. Community service for a month, maybe.
PUPPY: (Loud, distressed yelp!)
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (eyes snap open, horrified, dropping staff with a CLANG) ZAHIR! You let that innocent creature feel PAIN? This is an outrage! Three years! No, five! Straight to the maximum security camel stable! And you, Saba! For witnessing this atrocity without intervening! Two months! Get them out of my sight!
SABA: (A tiny, almost inaudible sigh of pure, utter defeat.)

  🔊 AUDIO:
  Loud, desperate puppy yelps, clatter of dropped staff, rustling scrolls, Fahad's booming voice, Saba's barely audible sigh, a single mournful note on a string instrument
