CHAIRMAN FAHAD (suddenly alert, eyes wide with genuine horror, clutching his chest) has just dropped a beautiful, ceremonial camel staff (carved wood with silver inlay), which lays on the dusty floor. SABA (slumped, utterly defeated, expressionless save for a single tear silently tracing her cheek) stares vacantly forward. CLERK ZAHIR (terrified, wide-eyed, holding a tiny, fluffy white PUPPY that is yelping loudly) is frozen in fear, the puppy wiggling in his grasp. Fahad stumbles back from his desk, knocking over a stack of scrolls. Saba doesn't move, barely registers the chaos. Zahir tries to comfort the puppy but is more afraid of Fahad's reaction. A 'Protect Our Dromedaries' poster is visible in the background. Slow push-in on Fahad's horrified face, then a quick cut to an extreme close-up of the yelping puppy, then a static medium shot of Saba's utterly defeated expression, focusing on the tear. Dramatic lighting, sharp contrasts, heightened absurdity, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

DIALOGUE: SABA: (resigned, almost whispering) What about… a more severe human crime? What if someone… killed a person?
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (ponders, then waves a dismissive hand) Oh, a person? Ah, Article 21a. Family dispute. Perhaps a fine. Or a stern talking-to. Community service for a month, maybe.
PUPPY: (Loud, distressed yelp!)
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (eyes snap open, horrified, dropping staff with a CLANG) ZAHIR! You let that innocent creature feel PAIN? This is an outrage! Three years! No, five! Straight to the maximum security camel stable! And you, Saba! For witnessing this atrocity without intervening! Two months! Get them out of my sight!
SABA: (A tiny, almost inaudible sigh of pure, utter defeat.)
