SABA (face now showing tightly controlled frustration, eyes slightly wide with disbelief) is staring, unblinking, directly at the camera. CHAIRMAN FAHAD (calm, meticulous, his eyes focused) is delicately polishing a miniature, intricately carved wooden camel figurine with a small silk cloth on his desk. CLERK ZAHIR (grinning, eager to contribute, holding up a small scroll) looks expectantly at Fahad. Saba clenches her jaw. Fahad slowly rotates the camel figurine in his hand. Zahir unfurls the scroll. The camel figurine catches the dim light. Behind Zahir, a framed certificate reads 'Outstanding Service to Livestock.' Close-up on Saba's face, then cuts to a close-up on Fahad's hands polishing the camel, then a quick medium shot of Zahir. Muted, oppressive lighting, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

DIALOGUE: SABA: (voice tight, trying to remain respectful) Forgive my persistence, Excellency, but a human life… a broken bone versus… a slightly unhappy camel?
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (without looking up from polishing) A slightly unhappy camel can lead to a deeply unhappy caravan. A deeply unhappy caravan disrupts commerce. Disrupted commerce destabilizes the region. Do you wish to destabilize the region, Saba?
SABA: (swallowing, a beat of silence) No, Excellency. Of course not.
CLERK ZAHIR: (eagerly) And for disturbing the sleep of a rare white falcon? Article 19g states a full year, Excellency!
