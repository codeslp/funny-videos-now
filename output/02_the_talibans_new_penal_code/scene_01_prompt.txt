SABA (30s, modest olive-green tunic, determined expression) is seated opposite CHAIRMAN FAHAD (60s, stern face, traditional flowing white robes, heavy silver ring, adjusting spectacles). CLERK ZAHIR (20s, grey uniform, furiously scribbling in a large leather-bound ledger) sits beside Fahad, head down. Saba leans slightly forward, holding a crumpled legal document. Fahad holds a much larger, ornate ledger open on his dusty wooden desk, finger tracing lines. Zahir's pen scratches furiously. A brass teapot and flickering oil lamp are on the desk. A faded 'Justice Prevails' tapestry hangs crookedly on the mud-brick wall behind Fahad. Medium shot, slightly low angle on Saba, then a slow push-in to a close-up on Fahad's face as he speaks. Warm, oppressive golden hour lighting filtering through a small window, gritty realism, 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

DIALOGUE: SABA: (earnest but hopeful) But Excellency, surely two weeks for a broken arm is… lenient? She needed surgery.
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (calm, authoritative) The new code is clear. Section 7b. Assault causing minor fracture: two weeks. Next case.
SABA: (confused, a slight frown) Next case? But the severity...
CHAIRMAN FAHAD: (interrupting smoothly) Mistreating a desert dromedary, however, per Section 12c, carries a five-month incarceration. Perhaps even flogging.
