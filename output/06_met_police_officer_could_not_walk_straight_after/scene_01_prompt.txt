A close-up of a grizzled, world-weary INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATOR, mid-50s, tired eyes, dark suit, observing. His expression is a subtle mix of disbelief and resignation. In the background, out of focus, a DRUNK OFFICER in a slightly rumpled police uniform struggles to pick up a pen, swaying slightly. A CHIEF INSPECTOR, mid-40s, pristine uniform, tries to subtly steady the DRUNK OFFICER's arm. CAMERA: Static medium shot on INVESTIGATOR, subtle rack focus to background absurdity. STYLE: Harsh, institutional fluorescent lighting, cinematic, slightly desaturated colors. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Internal Affairs Investigator: (low, deadpan) The report states no impairment.
