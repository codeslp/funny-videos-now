A medium shot, eye-level, of the DRUNK OFFICER, mid-30s, uniform now visibly disheveled, attempting to walk a straight line across a brightly lit, sterile police conference room. The DRUNK OFFICER dramatically veers left, then rights themself by grabbing a 'POLICE CODE OF CONDUCT' poster and nearly pulling it off the wall. The CHIEF INSPECTOR, standing beside the 'straight line' (a strip of hazard tape), forces a confident smile, arms crossed. The Internal Affairs Investigator is visible in the background, out of focus, slowly shaking his head. CAMERA: Tracking shot, handheld, following the DRUNK OFFICER's wobbly path. STYLE: Overly bright, clinical lighting, cinematic. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Chief Inspector: (strained cheerfulness) Perfectly linear, Investigator.
