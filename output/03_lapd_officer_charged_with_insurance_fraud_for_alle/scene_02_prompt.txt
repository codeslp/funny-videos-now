Investigator Davis now stares intently at a printed photo held by Chief Reynolds. The photo shows a bulky, athletic police officer (Officer 'Rocket' Rodriguez) effortlessly deadlifting an oversized tractor tire with a huge grin. Davis's eye twitches subtly. Chief Reynolds points to the photo with a pen. CAMERA: Close-up on Davis's face, then quickly cutting to an extreme close-up of the photo. STYLE: Harsh office fluorescent lighting, stark contrast. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Chief Reynolds: (flatly) This was during his 'recovery.'
Investigator Davis: (sighs, to himself) Just… a strongman competition.
