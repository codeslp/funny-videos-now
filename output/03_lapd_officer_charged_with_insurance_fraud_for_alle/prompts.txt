=== SCENE 1 ===
Investigator Davis, a grizzled, middle-aged detective in a rumpled suit, squints at a thick medical file. His desk is cluttered with case folders and half-eaten snacks. Chief Reynolds, a calm, slightly overweight woman in a neat blouse, sips coffee beside him, looking unfazed. CAMERA: Medium shot on Davis, slowly pushing in to highlight his exhaustion. STYLE: Muted office lighting, weary mood. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Chief Reynolds: (calmly) Officer Rodriguez claims a bad back.
Investigator Davis: (muttering, defeated) Another one.

=== SCENE 2 ===
Investigator Davis now stares intently at a printed photo held by Chief Reynolds. The photo shows a bulky, athletic police officer (Officer 'Rocket' Rodriguez) effortlessly deadlifting an oversized tractor tire with a huge grin. Davis's eye twitches subtly. Chief Reynolds points to the photo with a pen. CAMERA: Close-up on Davis's face, then quickly cutting to an extreme close-up of the photo. STYLE: Harsh office fluorescent lighting, stark contrast. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Chief Reynolds: (flatly) This was during his 'recovery.'
Investigator Davis: (sighs, to himself) Just… a strongman competition.

=== SCENE 3 ===
Officer 'Rocket' Rodriguez, a powerfully built man with a freshly tanned face, sits uncomfortably in a standard office chair, still wearing a branded skydiving club t-shirt under his open jacket. On a large monitor behind him, a video shows him grinning mid-air, then smoothly landing with a parachute, and immediately collapsing into a waiting wheelchair with a dramatic wince. Investigator Davis stares blankly at the screen, utterly defeated. CAMERA: Medium shot, slowly pushing in on Davis's deadpan face. STYLE: Harsh overhead office lights, surreal video glow. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Officer Rodriguez: (indignant) My back was only hurt landing.
Chief Reynolds: (deadpan) We saw the jump, Rocket.
Investigator Davis: (silent, exhales slowly, staring)
