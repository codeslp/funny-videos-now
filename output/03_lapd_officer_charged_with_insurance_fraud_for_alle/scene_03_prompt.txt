Officer 'Rocket' Rodriguez, a powerfully built man with a freshly tanned face, sits uncomfortably in a standard office chair, still wearing a branded skydiving club t-shirt under his open jacket. On a large monitor behind him, a video shows him grinning mid-air, then smoothly landing with a parachute, and immediately collapsing into a waiting wheelchair with a dramatic wince. Investigator Davis stares blankly at the screen, utterly defeated. CAMERA: Medium shot, slowly pushing in on Davis's deadpan face. STYLE: Harsh overhead office lights, surreal video glow. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

Dialogue: Officer Rodriguez: (indignant) My back was only hurt landing.
Chief Reynolds: (deadpan) We saw the jump, Rocket.
Investigator Davis: (silent, exhales slowly, staring)
