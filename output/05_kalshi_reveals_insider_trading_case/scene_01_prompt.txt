Medium shot of DETECTIVE MILLER (40s, weary eyes, slightly rumpled suit, loose tie) pinching the bridge of his nose, seated at a bland beige conference table. Across from him, MARTHA (50s, severe bun, crisp blazer, stern expression) points a laser pen at a large projection screen showing abstract market charts. CHAD (20s, intense, earnest expression, wearing a black MrBeast logo hoodie) sits rigidly. Sterile office lighting. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio.

Dialogue: Martha: (authoritative) Your trades violated market integrity.
Chad: (indignant) I just knew the shark video would hit.
Miller: (weary sigh) 'Shark video.'
