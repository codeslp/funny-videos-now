POPE LEO, mid-70s, wearing traditional white papal vestments, sits stiffly at a heavy, ornate wooden desk. His face is a mask of weary exasperation as he holds a tablet displaying a video of a young priest in a brightly lit chapel performing a choppy, arm-waving 'sermon dance challenge' in front of an altar, a large 'SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON!' graphic superimposed over the crucifix. Behind the Pope, a second, smaller tablet shows another AI-generated 'sermon' using aggressive meme overlays. CARDINAL BENEDICT, looking increasingly overwhelmed, frantically tries to minimize windows on a third tablet, his brow furrowed in quiet horror. CAMERA: Close-up, slow push-in on Pope Leo's face, then rack focus to the tablets. STYLE: High contrast, almost frantic lighting, traditional meets digital. 9:16 vertical portrait aspect ratio

DIALOGUE: Pope Leo: (voice rising with incredulity) 'And this one suggests we integrate 'Holy Spirit filter challenges' into the Benediction! The youth crave engagement, they say! Engagement?!'
Cardinal Benedict: (softly, defeated) 'It's... it's just really good at identifying viral trends, Your Holiness.'
