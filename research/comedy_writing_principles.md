# Comedy Scriptwriting Principles for Short-Form AI Video

## Core Philosophy
Comedy is **tension and release**. The audience feels tension when a pattern is established, and the release (the laugh) comes when that pattern is broken in an unexpected way. Every principle below serves this one idea.

---

## 1. The Rule of Three (Establish → Reinforce → Subvert)
The minimum number of beats to create a pattern and then break it.

- **Beat 1 (Establish):** Introduce a normal, expected behavior or statement.
- **Beat 2 (Reinforce):** Repeat the same pattern to cement the audience's expectation.
- **Beat 3 (Subvert):** Break the pattern with something absurd, contradictory, or wildly escalated.

### Example Applied to Our Format
> **Headline:** "LAPD officer charged with insurance fraud for skydiving while on disability leave"
>
> **Beat 1:** A doctor examines a police officer in a neck brace. "Looks serious. Take 6 months off."
> **Beat 2:** The officer at home in a robe, wincing while reaching for the TV remote.
> **Beat 3:** Hard cut to the same officer, mid-skydive, doing a backflip with a GoPro selfie stick, screaming "YEAHHH!"

### Why It Works
The first two beats build trust ("okay, he's injured"). The third beat weaponizes that trust. The bigger the gap between the expectation and reality, the bigger the laugh.

## 2. The "Straight Man" Principle
Every absurd scene needs **one character who reacts the way the audience would.** They are the audience's surrogate.

- The Straight Man does NOT deliver jokes. They deliver **disbelief, exhaustion, and slow-building horror.**
- Their reactions **frame** the absurdity. Without them, the scene is just random nonsense.
- Comedic contrast: the more unhinged everyone else is, the funnier the Straight Man's quiet despair becomes.

### Anti-Pattern (What NOT to Do)
❌ Every character acting wacky → feels like noise, no anchor for the audience.
❌ The Straight Man also doing something absurd → undermines their role.

---

## 3. "Yes, And..." → Heightening / Escalation
From improv: every new beat must **accept the premise and raise the stakes.**

- Never deny the absurd thing that just happened. **Build on it.**
- Each escalation should feel like a logical (but insane) next step.
- The escalation should accelerate — the gaps between beats get shorter and wilder toward the end.

### Escalation Ladder Example
> **Premise:** A city council meeting about a pothole that's been open for 3 years.
> 1. A resident complains. Normal.
> 2. Another resident says a family of raccoons now lives in it. Slightly absurd.
> 3. A council member reveals the raccoons have filed for property tax exemption. Wildly absurd.
> 4. The raccoons' lawyer enters the meeting. Peak absurdity.

## 4. The "Game" of the Scene
Every scene has ONE funny thing — the **game**. Everything serves the game.

- **Find the unusual thing** about the real-world headline.
- Ask: "If this is true, what *else* is true?" — that's your game.
- Every line of dialogue, every visual gag, every character action should explore or escalate the game.
- **Do NOT introduce a second game.** One game per scene. Diluting focus kills comedy.

### Identifying the Game from a Headline
> **Headline:** "Social Security accidentally declares Dallas woman dead four times since 2017"
> **Game:** A woman keeps having to prove she's alive.
> **Exploration:** What increasingly ridiculous things does she have to do to prove it? Stand in front of a government worker and do jumping jacks? Bring her own obituary? Show up to her own funeral?

---

## 5. Specificity Over Generality
Vague jokes are forgettable. **Specific details are funnier.**

- ❌ "He was eating food" → ✅ "He was stress-eating an entire rotisserie chicken with his bare hands"
- ❌ "She was upset" → ✅ "She stared at the wall for 11 minutes without blinking"
- Specific details create vivid mental images, which are inherently funnier.

---

## 6. Visual & Physical Comedy (Critical for Veo3)
Since Veo3 generates video, **visual storytelling must carry the comedy**, not just dialogue.

- **Contrast shots:** A calm character next to a chaotic environment.
- **Reaction shots:** A deadpan close-up after something insane happens.
- **Physical escalation:** Actions that get progressively more unhinged.
- **Environmental storytelling:** The room itself tells a joke (e.g., a "Safety First" poster on a wall while everything is on fire).

---

## 7. Don't Explain the Joke
- If you have to explain why something is funny, it isn't funny.
- Trust the audience to connect the dots.
- The best comedy leaves a tiny gap the audience fills in themselves — that act of "getting it" is the laugh.

---

## 8. Timing & Pacing for Short-Form
- **Get into the scene late, get out early.** No setup preamble. Open on the action.
- **30-45 seconds max.** Attention spans are brutal.
- **The punchline should land in the final 3-5 seconds.** End on the biggest laugh.
- **Silence is a tool.** A beat of silence before a deadpan reaction is often funnier than rapid-fire dialogue.
